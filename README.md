# Firebase Tutorial: Make the CRUDiest Movies Database

The best way to learn is to build a project. This tutorial will teach you about the Firebase NoSQL cloud database while you build a movies database.

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

I assume that you know almost nothing about coding. However, I assume that you've set up your computer for software development, including:

* A _browser_, preferable Chrome.
* A _text editor_ such as Atom, Vim, Sublime, or WebStorm.

 If not, please see my tutorials [Set Up Your Computer](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/Set_Up_Your_Computer.md) and [Atom Editor](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/Atom_Editor.md).

Most software projects also require:

* A _terminal_ with access to your command line interface (CLI).
* Knowledge of basic _UNIX_ commands and tools.
* _Package managers_ including Homebrew, npm, and bower.
* A _shell_ such as Z-shell (zsh).

This project doesn't require any of that because we won't be building a back end or using a server. But if you're interested you can see my tutorials [UNIX and the Command Line](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/UNIX_and_the_Command_Line.md) and [Update Checklist](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/Update_Checklist.md).

## Chapters List

This tutorial is divided into several files because the Atom editor can be overwhelmed by long files. The files are:

1. [Firebase Principles]()
2. [Setting Up Firebase]()

5. [Firebase Auth]
