## Why Another Movies Database?

Every coding bootcamp student makes a movies database. I picture a hiring manager going through a stack of resumes, clicking on project after project, spending no more than seconds on each. If you make a unique, innovative project that takes time and effort to understand, the hiring manager will move on. I figure that the best way to impress a hiring manager is with a web app he or she can quickly understand and be impressed by, e.g., a well-executed movies database.

## Set Up Your Computer for Software Development

If you're new to coding you'll need a text editor and other software. I have tutorials for

* [UNIX and the Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/UNIX_and_the_Command_Line.md).
* [Updating checklist](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/Update_Checklist.md) to keep your software up to date every week.
* [Atom Text Editor](https://github.com/tdkehoe/Learn-To-Code-By-Breaking-Stuff/blob/master/Atom_Editor.md) for writing code.
